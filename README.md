GitHub Followers:   
Create a page that allows for a user to search for a GitHub username. 
On a successful search return, display the user's GitHub handle, follower count, and a list of the user's followers (just the avatar is fine). 
Since some users (e.g.taylorotwell, etc.) have many thousands of followers, GitHub only returns a portion of the followers with each request. 
Create a "load more" button that, when clicked, fetches the next payload of followers. 
This button should persist until there are no more pages of followers to fetch.
